# Description

Are you ready to apply your Power BI skills to a real-world dataset? For subscription-based businesses, reducing customer churn is a top priority. In this Power BI case study, you'll investigate a dataset from an example telecom company called Databel and analyze their churn rates. Analyzing churn doesn’t just mean knowing what the churn rate is: it’s also about figuring out why customers are churning at the rate they are, and how to reduce churn. You'll answer these questions by creating measures and calculated columns, while simultaneously creating eye-catching report pages.
