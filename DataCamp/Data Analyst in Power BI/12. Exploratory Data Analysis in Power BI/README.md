# Description

Enhance your reports with Power BI's Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). You'll start by using descriptive statistics to spot outliers, identify missing data, and apply imputation techniques to fill gaps in your dataset. You’ll then learn how EDA in Power BI can help you discover the relationships between variables—both categorical and continuous— by using basic statistical measures and box and scatter plots.
